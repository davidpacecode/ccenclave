Trash and Composting are picked up every Monday. Most people seem to put their cans out on Sunday The city requests that they be out by 5:30am on Monday.. You can request a different sized garbage can from the city.

Recycling is picked up every other Monday.

All cans should ideally be taken in sometime on Monday. When not out for collection, cans should be stored out of sight when looking at your house from the street. You may receive a warning if your cans are out too long or stored in sight from the street. This is by far and away the No. 1 reason youâ€™ll receive a naughty note from the HOA. Spectrum sends out a scout every other week, usually on a Friday. So, if you are going out of town for the weekend, ask someone to put your cans out for you.
