title: End of School Year Potluck Party

This normally takes place on the last day of the school year in the Enclave park. Bring a dish to share, chairs and a table. We take up a collection to rent a bounce house for the elementary age kids. Larger kids are invited, but we usually reserve the bounce house for anyone in elementary. Smaller bounce houses are usually there for toddlers. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to come out and meet their neighbors, regardless of whether you have kids. We always need help/volunteers to make this happen!
