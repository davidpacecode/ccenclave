The HOA board members are volunteers and your neighbors, so if Krystal can’t help, they are another point of contact. The board meets quarterly and invites all neighbors to attend the meetings via Zoom. Issues that the board commonly addresses: Fixing the gate, painting the gates, hanging the holiday lights (managing the storage of the lights year-round), keeping the budget on track, relationships with all our vendors, the resurfacing of the road, which is private, and not a public street, and less pleasant things, like collecting fines for those who don’t pay fees or making sure people follow the rules. Other things in the past have included instituting a speed limit, etc.
