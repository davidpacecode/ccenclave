According to most school ranking sites, we are blessed to be zoned to one of the best Elementary schools in Austin. [Clayton Elementary](https://www.austinisd.org/schools/clayton) is accessible via the gate in our park on Brecourt Manor Way. The gate leads directly to a crosswalk which leads to Clayton. The legendary Jim the crossing guard has been escorting the children of the Enclave across the street for several years. Jim is extremely nice and can offer next-level stock and real estate investment advice.

If you are driving your children to Clayton, note that there is a daily car backup on Lacrosse between 7:20am and 7:40am for drop off and between 2:40pm and 3:10pm for pickup. Please allow ample time.

*“Oh, we're the Clayton Cardinals,* <br />
*Red, white and blue <CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP!>* <br />
*Clayton Cardinals,* <br />
*Loyal through and through.”* <br />
