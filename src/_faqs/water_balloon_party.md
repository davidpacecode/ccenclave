This event is usually held the weekend before school starts. This year, the event will be on Saturday, August 13. See details of the [2022 Water Balloon Party here.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/356396297719269/permalink/8686417568050392/) As you pull through the gate to the neighborhood, we usually take over the area to the right. Please, drive to the left to avoid all the kiddos in the street.
