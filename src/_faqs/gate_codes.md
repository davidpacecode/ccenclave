The Gate Code for entering our community in a motor vehicle via the entrance on Spruce Canyon Drive is 6483. No need to press any other symbols, just the 4 numbers.

To request a new custom gate code…Fill out this form on the Spectrum website:

To request a remote control to open the gates….
Gate openers can be reprogrammed if they stop working. Open the remote, and check to make sure the code is working. It should be like this: **Open: 1,5,7,10 Closed: 2,3,4,6,8,9.**

To enter the community on foot via the gates on either side of the motor vehicle gate or via the two gates located on Lacrosse Ave:
- Press 1 and 4 simultaneously
- Press 3
- Turn the handle completely and open the gate
- A handy way to remember this is 4-1=3!

<add who to contact in case the gate isn’t working>
