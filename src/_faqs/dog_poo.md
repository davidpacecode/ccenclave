title: Do not throw your dog’s poo into OPG (other people’s garbage)

You’re walking your dog. Your dog poos. You pick up the poo and throw it into someone’s garbage can. Someone sees this, and makes a dramatic post complaining about it on facebook.

I will now indulge the inner NFL color commentator/analyst, which unfortunately never materialized for me, and break this situation down.

- Picking up after one’s dog is inarguably laudable. Keep our community clean. Great work!
- Putting it into someone else’s garbage can will likely stink up said garbage a little more than the garbage already in there. Also, some people pay to have their garbage cans cleaned <insert link>.
- If your worst problem is that someone put dog poo in your garbage can, you are blessed.
- Complaining about it on facebook outs not only the person putting dog poo into your can but also you as the kind of person who would complain about something like this on facebook.
- Breaking down this situation in and FAQ may be the worst of all

In summary, every single actor in the story above is wrong. The best course of action is to avoid this unpleasantness entirely and dispose of the dog poo in one of the community garbage cans or your own.
