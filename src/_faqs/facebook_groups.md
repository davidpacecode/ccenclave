[Circle C Enclave](https://www.facebook.com/groups/356396297719269)
A small group for the Circle C Enclave Community. We discuss issues germane to our awesome neighborhood. Some past topics include offers for dog walking, heads up on community events such as [Food Truck Nights,](https://www.bestfoodtrucks.com/lots/circlecatx) and other useful information.

Main Circle C Group
A bigger group for all of Circle C. Since it represents the larger community, this group tends to be a bit more active. Check out this group for discussion on things ranging from doctor and travel recommendations to snake removal and flame wars about bike lanes and putting one’s dog poo into the garbage cans of others.
