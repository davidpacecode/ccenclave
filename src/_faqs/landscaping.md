Jose does best in person. He’s not great at answering his phone or returning calls or texts. He does A LOT for our community, from mowing our front yards in the park and taking out our park’s trash. He also spreads mulch in our front yards annually and takes care of our flower beds by the gate. He mows the green belt, stretching from LaCrosse to the other Enclave. For $35/month [need to confirm], he will mow your yard weekly (no matter your yard size, but he will not blow your patio or do a lot of bells and whistles). Pay by the month or annually. Checks go in the metal pay box by the mailboxes. Generally, he comes on Thursdays but can be here on Wednesdays or Fridays if he has a lot to do. He will be happy to do additional work for you and provide a bid, but best to ask in person.
